      <h3>Hello, I’m</h3>
      <h1>Rishabh Raj Tandon</h1>
      <h3><span class="multiple-text"></span></h3>
      <p>
        I am a Bachelor of Commerce student at Macquarie University specialising in finance, sustainability, and operations analytics. 
        My Capstone project, <strong>TerraCare: Soil Regeneration as a Service</strong>, represents my passion for linking finance with sustainable impact. 
        This ePortfolio highlights how academic learning, teamwork, and professional insight have shaped my readiness for a career in sustainable finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the Capstone, I collaborated with a diverse group to address United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15: Life on Land through a business model 
        that combined profitability and ecological regeneration. Industry professionals also provided valuable insights that strengthened my learning, including

      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to pursue a career in impact and sustainable finance, using data analysis and strategic thinking to drive measurable change for organisations and communities.

    <div class="about-content">
      <h2 class="heading">Capstone Project: <span>TerraCare</span></h2>

      <p>
        TerraCare is a soil regeneration consulting service designed to combat soil degradation in regional Australia while achieving both financial and environmental outcomes. 
        The project aligns with <strong>UN SDG 15: Life on Land</strong>, focusing on sustainable land use and biodiversity renewal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The business operates through a partnership with Macquarie University, where under the Work Integrated Learning framework, students from engineering, biodiversity, 
        and business contribute to drone testing, soil analysis, and data evaluation. Academic supervision ensures scientific accuracy while lowering research and development costs 
        and creating real-world learning opportunities (Macquarie University, 2024).
      </p>

      <p>
        As the finance analyst, I developed a five-year investment plan supported by capital budgeting, discounted cash flow, and sensitivity analysis. 
        Using a phased deployment of one million dollars, TerraCare achieved positive cash flow by Year 3 and an after-tax return of 18.9 percent, 
        outperforming the national GDP growth benchmark. This demonstrated that sustainability initiatives can also deliver commercial success.
      </p>

        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fady-daher-ba5b48/?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank">the Chief Executive Officer of SoCreative</a>

        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-knight-641b7a7/?originalSubdomain=au" target="_blank">the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Macquarie University</a> 
        highlighted the importance of structured problem solving. 
        Both perspectives influenced my financial approach, ensuring that TerraCare’s outcomes remained practical, evidence based, and scalable.

          The Agility Challenge feedback highlighted that my financial projections lacked real-world context.

          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-garth/" target="_blank">the Assurance Associate at EY</a>

  <!-- CAREER -->
  <section class="career" id="career">
    <h2>Career and <span>Employability Development</span></h2>
    <p>
      Based on academic feedback and industry insights, I have developed a targeted plan for ongoing professional development:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete Advanced Excel Certification by December 2025 to enhance data interpretation and financial reporting</li>
      <li>Begin preparation for CFA Level 1 with a focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) analysis</li>
      <li>Seek mentorship through Macquarie University’s alumni network to gain exposure to sustainable finance practices</li>
      <li>Build a portfolio of impact analysis projects focused on agricultural and climate related investments by mid 2026</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These structured steps reflect my ability to identify skill gaps and apply evidence based strategies for professional growth. 
      They also demonstrate the capacity for self regulation, showing how I translate feedback into measurable development outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Capstone reinforced that employability extends beyond technical expertise. It involves adaptability, communication, teamwork, and integrity. 
      These qualities will guide me as I pursue a career that combines financial innovation with ethical impact.
    </p>

  <!-- FINAL REFLECTION -->
  <section class="summary" id="summary">
    <h2>Final <span>Reflection</span></h2>
    <p>
      The MQBS3010 Capstone experience reshaped my perspective on finance, collaboration, and sustainability. 
      Through TerraCare, I learned that profitability and environmental stewardship can coexist when guided by disciplined planning and ethical leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feedback from my tutor and industry professionals helped me transform uncertainty into structured action. 
      I now approach challenges as opportunities for growth, viewing feedback as a catalyst rather than criticism. 
      The experience deepened my understanding of reflective practice and the importance of aligning finance with broader human and ecological systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I plan to continue developing through mentorship, certification, and professional projects that combine data analysis with sustainable outcomes. 
      My goal is to become a finance professional who drives organisational success while supporting the transition toward a sustainable economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unit taught me that continuous learning, reflection, and curiosity form the foundation of professional excellence. 
      As I progress, I will apply these lessons to create both financial and social value in every role I undertake.
