      <h2 class="heading">Capstone Project: <span>TerraCare</span></h2>
      <p>
        TerraCare is a soil regeneration consulting service that restores degraded farmland while promoting biodiversity and long-term profitability. 
        The initiative aligns with <strong>UN SDG 15: Life on Land</strong> and integrates business viability with sustainability outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Macquarie University’s Work Integrated Learning framework, 60–80 students annually contribute to TerraCare’s development, combining academic research with real-world innovation. 
        As the finance analyst, I developed a five-year investment model using NPV, ROI, and sensitivity analysis, achieving a projected ROI of 18.9% by Year 3, validating that ecological regeneration and profitability can coexist.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work connected finance with marketing, accounting, and governance components. The marketing strategy refined TerraCare’s value proposition; the accounting chapter ensured transparent sustainability reporting; and the governance model implemented secure data practices aligned with ISO 27001 standards.
